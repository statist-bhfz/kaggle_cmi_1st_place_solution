# kaggle_cmi_1st_place_solution
Kaggle competition https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/cmi-detect-behavior-with-sensor-data/ 1st place solution by Devin | Ogurtsov | zyz team

Training notebooks from `public_solution_ogurtsov` could be mapped to inference notebook by experiment number in file name, e.g. `exp_339`. 
`_comb` in file name means "for this model best result per fold was picked among 3 runs" (it's not crucial part of the solution, results from single run play almost equally well in the final ensemble).
